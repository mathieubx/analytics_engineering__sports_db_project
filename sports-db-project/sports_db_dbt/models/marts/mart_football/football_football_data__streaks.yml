      (1) Why is the streak_end_at computed with 'MAX(is_team_last_match) = 1' as the first condition? 
      Well, the MAX(...) = 1 is forced by the fact that the SELECT statement is grouped. I just want to flag is a streak is an ongoing one.
      I used this trick because, indeed, MAX(is_team_last_match) returns 1 when the group of streak_id, team_id, and competition_id has a 1 for this column in it (which means that the streaks contains the teams' last match, and therefore that it's an ongoing streak.)
